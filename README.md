Midterm Project

**About the Project:**
Nitrogen (N) plays a critical role as a mineral nutrient essential for the growth and yield of cotton. Traditionally, Georgia cotton growers have relied on a standardized N application approach, which carries both benefits and limitations. While this method simplifies field management by applying a consistent dosage throughout the area, it fails to account for the inherent spatial and temporal variability within the field. Additionally, uncertainty persists regarding the optimal quantity of N fertilizer required each year, further complicating matters. To address these challenges, innovative strategies leveraging advanced sensor technology, variable-rate N applications, and real-time monitoring of crop N status have emerged as crucial solutions. In this context, the proposal advocates for the adoption of sensor technology to detect N stress in cotton plants, enabling precise and timely adjustments to in-season N requirements. The data we collect from the sensor can help us better understand the potentiality of these sensors to detect N stress and compare  the sensor based approach with the traditional approach.

The study was conducted in Midville, Georgia ($33.72^\circ$N, $83.30^\circ$W) on an irrigated field where cotton was planted on May 25, 2023. Each experimental plot measured $9.14, \text{m}$ by $7.31, \text{m}$ (equivalent to $30$ feet by $24$ feet) and comprised of eight rows of cotton. The treatment design included a total of seven treatments, involving different side-dress N rates ranging from $0$ to $128, \text{kg N}, \text{ha}^{-1}$, and included one sensor-based treatment.

The ACS-435 Crop Circle (Holland Scientific, Lincoln, NE), an active crop canopy sensor, was utilized for data collection and retrieval of NDRE index values from each plot. This index, obtained at the first square growth stage just before N application, involved handheld scanning of the third and fourth rows of each plot. Plot average NDRE values were then derived and utilized with the algorithm to determine plot-specific N rates, which were subsequently applied using a tractor-pulled sprayer. Each plot was individually harvested 170 days after planting. Cotton lint yield was determined post-processing the samples by separating lint from seeds, a process known as ginning. The harvested cotton from the field is seed-cotton (seed + cotton fiber). After ginning, the seed-cotton is separated into cotton fiber and seed, with the latter being discarded, and the fiber yield representing the lint yield (cotton fiber - seed).
